# Web RAG Chatbot
Web User Interface to Chat with Documents

## Overview
This project is for educational purpose, and its goal is the better understanding of:
- MySQL databases (create table schemas, procedure for more secure practices and authentication)
- ollama and their API
- RAG systems that enable information extraction from documents using llamaindex
- Hugginface

Models used in the repo include:
- "llama3.2" as SLM (Small Language Model)
- "BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5" access from Hugging Face for embeddings
- "openai/whisper-tiny" access from Hugging Face for audio to text pipeline

If you plan on using this project, you must comply with the licenses and conditions.


## Features
- Summarize Youtube videos using audio transcriptions
- Utilizes models from Ollama and Hugging Face such as phi3 and llama3
- Provides a web user chat interface for interaction
- Parses the YouTube link from the input text, downloads the transcription, and processes it with the LLM.
- Talk with documents in the data folder


## Notes and Observations
- This project was built from knowledge acquired in the repo _carlos-dev-research/vid-audio-summarizer/_ 
- **Database Security:** The database was designed with built-in security measures using stored procedures to handle authentication, ensuring that access to data is controlled directly at the database level. This prevents unauthorized access or data breaches due to impersonation of the web server.
- **Noisy Transcriptions:** When the video transcription contains noisy text, the model is more likely to hallucinate. For example, repetitive nonsensical words that are sometimes output by Whisper Tiny model with complicated text.
- **Progressive Summarization:** Applying custom loops to summarize information progressively could help compress information and enable the LLM to produce better summaries.
- **NoSQL Databases** For large scale applications NoSQL database could prove more suited for handling chat history, they are easier to scale horizontally and the consistency of the chat information is not critical
- **Video Summarization:** the video summarization is not reliable as it depends on pytube and it constantly changing according to how Youtube changes its web request structure

### If using Ubuntu 22 you can use the following
#### Install Docker
```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

# Install docker packages
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

# Verify installation
sudo docker run hello-world
```
#### Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit
```bash
# Install NVIDIA container toolkit
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2204/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit-12-5
```
#### Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit
```bash
# Install nvidia container toolkit
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
    && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
     tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit

sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
sudo systemctl restart docker
```


## Warnings
- **Accuracy:** Content generated by the LLM might be highly inaccurate.
- **Hallucination:** Larger videos are more likely to result in hallucinations.
- **Educational Use Only:** The video and image content are not endorsed in any way and are just for educational purposes.
